# Project:
## Title:
# c05-Day-Planner

## Description:
As for our fifth week of homework for this assignment we (Columbia Engineering Bootcamp students) were given the following user story below and acceptance criteria:

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

This homework was not as bad as the previous assignments but definitely got tricky handling moment library and working with siblings and children traversing the DOM in Jquery. However it only took me a few hours to figure out.

Thanks for reading!
